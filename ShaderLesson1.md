As discussed, we need to write *vertex* and *fragment* scripts in order for our shader program to work. This first example will use the exact same shaders as defined in the SpriteBatch (as you can see if you were to print `SpriteBatch.DEFAULT_VERT_SHADER` and `SpriteBatch.DEFAULT_FRAG_SHADER`), with one minor difference: we will invert the final colour. For example, it will look as if we applied Photoshop's Invert Color function.

In this series, we will use text files (`.vert` and `.frag`) for easier editing. When you go to release and distribute your games, you may want to embed the GLSL in your Java source as a String. Eclipse includes a [feature for pasting multi-line strings](http://www.vasanth.in/2009/03/10/eclipse-tip-escape-text-when-pasting/) which will be helpful.

Before we go into GLSL and how to write shaders, let's take a quick look at how we are creating them from our Java application:

## Set-Up

```java
//load our shader program and sprite batch
try {
	//read the files into strings
	final String VERTEX = Util.readFile(Util.getResourceAsStream("res/shadertut/lesson1.vert"));
	final String FRAGMENT = Util.readFile(Util.getResourceAsStream("res/shadertut/lesson1.frag"));
	
	//create our shader program -- be sure to pass SpriteBatch's default attributes!
	ShaderProgram program = new ShaderProgram(VERTEX, FRAGMENT, SpriteBatch.ATTRIBUTES);
	
	//create our sprite batch
	batch = new SpriteBatch(program);
} catch (Exception e) { 
	// ... handle the exception ... 
}
```

For convenience, we use the [Util](https://github.com/mattdesl/lwjgl-basics/blob/master/test/mdesl/test/Util.java) class to read our text files. We then create our shader program and specify the attribute locations with the third parameter. This tells ShaderProgram how the attributes will be laid out; since SpriteBatch expects them to be in a specific order (i.e. Position is expected at index 0). 

Then, we create our SpriteBatch using our custom shader.
