As you might have noticed from the [Display](DisplayCreation) and [Textures](Textures) tutorial, there is a lot of OpenGL-specific code that could be wrapped inside of neat object-oriented classes like Texture, TextureRegion, Color, etc. Instead of cluttering each tutorial up with endless amounts of boilerplate, I have wrapped these essential classes in an API you can grab [here](https://github.com/mattdesl/lwjgl-basics).
